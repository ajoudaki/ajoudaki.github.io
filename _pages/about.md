I'm a doctoral candidate in the [Biomedical Informatics (BMI)](https://bmi.inf.ethz.ch) group at ETH, where I work on mathematical foundations of neural networks, and biomedical applications of AI. Before joining ETH, I earned a BSc in Computer Engineering from Sharif University, an MPhil in Cognitive Neuroscience at SISSA, Italy, and an MSc in Computer Science from ETH Zurich. You can find my CV [here](/cv).


**Research collaboration.** I'm very open to collaborative research efforts and mentoring future MSc students. Please have a look [here](/projects/) if you find something interesting.
