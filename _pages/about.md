I'm a doctoral candidate in the biomedical informatics group, where I can work on the intersections between theoretical and applied problems in machine learning. In particular, I am interested in the theoretically driven understanding of neural networks to design faster and more reliable models. These theoretical understandings will be crucial for the safety-critical applications of ML/AI models, particularly biomedicine.


Before joining BMI, I did a BSc in computer engineering at Sharif University, an MPhil in cognitive neuroscience at SISSA, Italy, and an MSc in computer science at ETH Zurich.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
