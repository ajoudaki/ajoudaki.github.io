I'm a doctoral candidate in the biomedical informatics group, where I can work on the intersections between theoretical and applied problems in machine learning. In particular, I am interested in the theoretically driven understanding of neural networks to design faster and more reliable models. These theoretical understandings will be crucial for the safety-critical applications of ML/AI models, particularly biomedicine.


Before joining BMI, I did a BSc in computer engineering at Sharif University, an MPhil in cognitive neuroscience at SISSA, Italy, and an MSc in computer science at ETH Zurich.
