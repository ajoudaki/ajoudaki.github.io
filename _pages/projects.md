I'm very open to collaboration. Don't hesitate to contact me if you want to collaborate on any of the topics I work on. If you're a masters student looking for interesting projects to do during your studies or for your thesis, here is a list of available projects for MSc theses. Please send me an email with your CV and transcripts if you're interested!
